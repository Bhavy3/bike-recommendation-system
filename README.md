# Project Title

This project is a machine learning application that uses a pre-trained model to make predictions. The main script is `app.py`, and it utilizes the model stored in `model3.pkl`.

## Files

- **app.py**: Main application script. Run this file to start the app.
- **model3.pkl**: Pre-trained machine learning model used by the app.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt` (if available). Common packages may include pandas, scikit-learn, etc.

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

Make sure `model3.pkl` is in the same directory as `app.py` or update the path in the script if needed.

## Notes

- If you encounter missing package errors, install them using pip.
- For more details on the model or data, refer to the code and comments in `app.py`.
